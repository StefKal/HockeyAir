# HockeyAir
This project was created as part of my senior year project. It was part of a group effort with my classmate Dylan Dechiara. 

This is a complete Android Air-Hockey multi-player game based on Wi-Fi Direct P2P network. 
It was made possible through the use of android handlers, sockets, serialization, threads
